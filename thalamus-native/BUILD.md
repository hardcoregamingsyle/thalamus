# Building the Thalamus desktop app

This is the **native Windows app**. It is WPF on **.NET 8** — real C#, no Electron, no WebView2, no Qt. If you read an older doc talking about Qt 6, CMake, or WiX, it was describing a version that no longer exists. Ignore it. This is the truth.

Two projects live here:

| Project | Output | What it is |
|---|---|---|
| `ThalamusApp/ThalamusApp.csproj` | `Thalamus.exe` | The actual app |
| `ThalamusInstaller/ThalamusInstaller.csproj` | `ThalamusSetup.exe` | A tiny WPF installer that lays the app down and wires up Windows |

Both target `net8.0-windows` and publish as **self-contained, single-file, win-x64**. That means the person running it does not need .NET installed. It just runs.

---

## What you need

- **.NET 8 SDK** — the one non-negotiable. Grab it: https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/8
- **Inno Setup 6** — optional. Only needed if you want the polished `Thalamus-Setup-*.exe` wrapper. Without it the build still spits out working `.exe`s, it just skips the pretty installer. https://jrsoftware.org/isdl.php
- **QEMU** — runtime-only, and not your problem at build time. The installer pulls it down (or the app downloads it on first VM boot) for the VM Sandbox.

That's the whole list. If `dotnet --list-sdks` shows an 8.x (or newer), you're good.

---

## The one command

```powershell
cd thalamus-native
.\build.ps1
```

That script does everything: checks your SDK, publishes both projects, stages `installer-build\`, compiles the Inno Setup installer if Inno is present, and writes SHA-256 checksums. Flags if you want them:

```powershell
.\build.ps1 -Version "1.3.0"   # stamp a version
.\build.ps1 -SkipInno          # skip the Inno wrapper (no Inno Setup installed)
.\build.ps1 -SkipInstaller     # app only, don't build the installer project
```

Output lands here:

```
ThalamusApp\bin\Release\net8.0-windows\win-x64\publish\Thalamus.exe
ThalamusInstaller\bin\Release\net8.0-windows\win-x64\publish\ThalamusSetup.exe
dist\Thalamus-Setup-<version>.exe   (only if Inno ran)
dist\checksums.txt
```

---

## Doing it by hand

Don't want the script? Fine.

```powershell
# The app
dotnet publish ThalamusApp\ThalamusApp.csproj -c Release -r win-x64 `
  --self-contained true -p:PublishSingleFile=true

# The installer
dotnet publish ThalamusInstaller\ThalamusInstaller.csproj -c Release -r win-x64 `
  --self-contained true -p:PublishSingleFile=true
```

For a quick dev loop, skip publishing and just build:

```powershell
dotnet build ThalamusApp\ThalamusApp.csproj -c Debug
```

A clean build is **0 warnings, 0 errors**. Keep it that way — if you add a warning, you fix a warning.

> Heads-up on the installer project: WPF's single-file publish spins up a temp `*_wpftmp` project and sometimes trips over a stale `obj\`/`bin\`. `build.ps1` already nukes those before publishing. If you're building by hand and it gets weird, `Remove-Item ThalamusInstaller\bin,ThalamusInstaller\obj -Recurse -Force` and try again.

```

The app talks to the Convex backend over HTTP/SSE. The VM Sandbox drives QEMU through `QemuBridgeManager` (native C# — it replaced the old Node bridge) and paints the framebuffer with an embedded RFB 3.8 VNC client. No external VNC viewer required.

### The ISO catalog is legal-sources-only. Keep it that way.

`IsoLibrary.cs` is the single place the OS catalog lives. Every entry points at an **official, freely downloadable** image — vendor evaluations (Windows 11 Enterprise eval) or open-source releases (Ubuntu, Debian, Kali, Android-x86). Nothing ships inside the app or installer; images download on demand (with pause/resume) into `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Thalamus\ISOs` and each one can be deleted from the UI. Anything without an official free download — retail Windows, macOS (licence-locked to Apple hardware), whatever — is *not* in the catalog and never will be. That's what the **Custom ISO** entry is for: the user brings a file they own, we boot it. If you touch the catalog, verify the URL actually resolves before you commit it, and record the byte size.

### The installer is also the uninstaller

`ThalamusInstaller` downloads and lays down the app, QEMU, TightVNC, and aria2, then copies **itself** into the install dir as `ThalamusSetup.exe` and registers `HKCU\...\Uninstall\Thalamus` so Windows' Add/Remove Programs shows a real entry. Running `ThalamusSetup.exe /uninstall` (which is exactly what that entry does) opens a themed confirmation window, kills running Thalamus processes, and removes files, shortcuts, and registry keys. VM disks and downloaded ISOs survive unless the user explicitly ticks the delete-my-data box. The exe hands its own deletion to a delayed `cmd.exe` because Windows won't let a running binary delete itself.

To point the app at a different backend: **Settings → General** at runtime. No rebuild.

---

## Shipping a release

```powershell
.\build.ps1 -Version "1.3.0"
gh release create v1.3.0 dist\Thalamus-Setup-v1.3.0.exe dist\checksums.txt `
  --repo hardcoregamingsyle/thalamus --title "Thalamus v1.3.0"
```

Then update the download link on the website so people actually get the new one.

## When it won't build

| Symptom | Fix |
|---|---|
| `NETSDK1045: does not support targeting .NET N` | You're on an older SDK than the project targets. Install .NET 8+. |
| Installer publish fails with a `_wpftmp` error | Stale `obj\`/`bin\`. Delete them and rebuild (the script does this for you). |
| `Inno Setup not found` warning | Expected if Inno isn't installed. The `.exe`s still build; only the wrapped setup is skipped. |
| VM Sandbox: "bridge not responding" | QEMU/bridge not present yet. First VM boot downloads them; give it a minute. |
